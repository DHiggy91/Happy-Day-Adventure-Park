# Happy-Day-Adventure-Park
Project Description 
Happy Day Adventure Park was created as a framework for the Generation Project. The Project gives us an example to showcase our skillsets in the different coding languages that we have learned. It also serves as an example for work completed to demonstrate skillset. 
This assignment will model a website for a made up amusement park which we are calling Happy Day Adventure Park. The following is how we broke down the project:
1.	Home: The home page will offer a general welcome to the website and a brief description of the park.
2.	About: This page will provide an in depth description of the park. This will include history and founding members information.
3.	Rides and Experience: Description of activities and shops at the amusement park. This will create a visual for what to expect when inside of the amusement park.
4.	Plan Your Visit: This will allow guests to view a calendar and see when the best time for them to come to the park. They will be able to determine peak times and view any possible events going on.
5.	Tickets & Parks: This page will show you prices of the tickets including family packs, senior discounts, season tickets, and any other special offers. 
6.	Contact page: This will provide a form to contact us as well phone number and email address.
As a group this project is exciting to work on. As we have worked so hard in the class we finally get to show off what we have learned.
